# 🚀 Notification Prioritization Engine

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a real-time **Notification Prioritization Engine** that classifies incoming notifications into:

- ✅ **NOW** – Send immediately  
- ⏳ **LATER** – Defer / schedule  
- ❌ **NEVER** – Suppress  

The system reduces notification overload, prevents duplicates, mitigates alert fatigue, supports configurable rules, and logs every decision for auditability.
